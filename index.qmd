* Gram-negative bacilli occurring naturally in the GI tract
* Resistant to carbapenem antibiotics
* Several different carbapenemases genes in CPE:
  * Imipenemase (IMP)
  *  Klebsiella penumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)
  *  New-Delhi metallo-β-lactamase (NDM)
  * Verona integron-encoded metallo-β-lactamase (VIM) and
  *  Oxacillinases (OXA)
*  For Enterobacterales, IMP(-4) most commonly found in Victoria (28% of all cases)
* Assumed to be colonised indefinitely

## Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales {.smaller}

* Surveillance officially established in Victoria in 2015, became notifiable in 2018
* Since becoming notifiable, notifications have been steadily increasing

## Modelling possible control

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width='50%'}

* We know that healthcare is a network phenomenon
* Need to understand if CPE+ patients are different to CPE- patients

## Health Services in Victoria, Australia {.smaller}

* Health services are individually governed
* Centralised guidelines for reporitng
* Have their own IP results, testing/screening requirements, admission & transfer patterns
* Are often spread across multiple campuses which operate independently but are administered centrally

::: {.fragment}
As these services tend to operate on the same patient data platform, we assume that previously diagnosed patients will have infection prevention protocols in place if they are re-admitted to the same service.

This is less likely to be true in a different health service, as there is no centralised notification system to other health services.

:::

## Notification system

![](images/echidna-notification-letter.png){fig-align="center"}

## Data sources {.smaller}

Victorian Admitted Episodes Dataset (VAED):

* Line list of every hospital admission (public and private)
* Reports demographics, conditions, treatments, timing, location

Public Health Event Surveillance System (PHESS):

* Records information on *notifiable* disease events
* Includes patient demographics, date of notification, date of test
* Operational system, used for contact tracing and outbreak analytics

## Network construction

We model how patients move around the network.

* Nodes: Hospital (physical)
* Edge: Transfer of patient between two hospitals, within 365 days
* Weight: Number of patients transferred

::: {.fragment}
This is a weighted, directed network. The worst kind of non-temporal network.
:::

## Network construction {.smaller}

* Clustering: Infomap (based on a random walk through the network)

$$\max_{M} L(M) = q H(\mathcal{Q}) + \sum_{i=1}^m p^{i} H(\mathcal{P}^i)$$

::: {.fragment}
Effectively maximising entropy of the "walk" subject to a partition, $Q$, weighting within and between cluster movements.

$p$ and $q$ informed by edge weights
:::

## Network construction {.smaller}
* Importance of certain facilites: Adjusted Rand Index

$$R = \frac{a+b}{a+b+c+d} = \frac{a+b}{n\choose 2},$$

where

* $a$ is the number of pairs of elements that are in the same subset in $X$ and the same subset in $Y$,
* $b$ be the number of pairs of elements that are in different subsets in $X$ and different subsets of $Y$,
* $c$ be the number of pairs of elements that are in the same subset in $X$ and different subsets in $Y$ and,
* $d$ be the number of pairs of elements that are in different subsets in $X$ and the same subset in $Y$.

```{r}

comma_formatter <- scales::label_comma(accuracy = 1, big.mark = ",", decimal.mark = ".")

demographics <- tribble(
  ~type, ~label, ~N,
  "Gender", "Male", 12723729 |> comma_formatter(),
  "Gender", "Female", 14071488 |> comma_formatter(),

## Network exploration

* Density: High (0.44)
* Clustering: Reasonably strong (foreshadowing)

## Node importance

ARI: Interpret at proportion of clustering structure "preserved"

::: {.fragment .incremental}
* Removing small and same-day facilities gives an ARI of between 0.58 and 0.62
  * Seems key to making connections between larger hospitals
  * Removing one-by-one or all doesn't notably change ARI
* Removing public hospitals gives ARI of 0.22
* Removing private hospitals gives ARI of 0.58
:::

## Next steps {.smaller}

::: {.incremental}

* Hospital system is dense, geographically clustered
* Transfers are incredibly frequent, tend to move towards metropolitan Melbourne
* Need to include pretty much all facilities in system consideration

* Surveillance should be considered geographically
  * Local public health units?
* Impact of patients going home
* Testing/sampling for conditions

:::

::: {.fragment}
This is a very extensive and detailed dataset, with many more project ideas than time.

But presents an exciting opportunity to build a data-driven surveillance and outbreak response system.
